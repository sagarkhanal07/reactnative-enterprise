## 📚 Features (TODO)

- [X] Expo - Built with Expo for cross-platform support
- [X] 🎯 Absolute imports - For better imports and code organization
- [X] 📝 Conventional commits git hook - For enforcing conventional commits
- [ ] 🤖 Renovate BOT - For keeping dependencies up to date
- [X] 🛠️ Extremely strict TypeScript - With ts-reset library for ultimate type safety
- [ ] 🩹 Patch-package - For patching dependencies
- [ ] 💻 T3 Env - For environment variables management
- [ ] 📊 Bundle analyzer plugin - For analyzing bundle size
- [ ] 🧪 Jest and React Testing Library - For testing components and features
- [ ] 📕 Storybook - For isolating and testing UI components
- [ ] 📈 Components coupling and cohesion graph - For analyzing components relations
- [ ] 🚀 GitHub Actions - For CI/CD automation
- [X] 🤖🧠 Automated ChatGPT Code Reviews - For improving code quality and AI assistance code reviews
- [ ] 🚢 Semantic Release - For automated versioning and CHANGELOG generation


## 🚦 Roadmap (Updated as implemented)

### Expo
Project Initiated with
```sh
npx create-expo-app --template
```

### Absolute Imports
Clean code and code writing easier.
Preconfigured by default.

### Conventional Commits
Configured with [git-conventioanl-commits](https://github.com/qoomon/git-conventional-commits) to automatically validate commit messages following the [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.

### TS-Reset | Extremely Strict Typescript
TypeScript's default type declarations may have imperfections, but [ts-reset](https://github.com/total-typescript/ts-reset) enhances them.

### Automated ChatGPT Code Reviews
Configured with [chatgpt-codereview](https://github.com/anc95/ChatGPT-CodeReview) action workflow.
